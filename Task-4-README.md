# Task #4 - Create data

This assignment aims at strengthening our scripting skills and learning how to create a well-formed dataset to work with. 

We will extend what we do in this assignment in the next one, so keep that in mind.

We will create a short questionnaire and then use Bash to script collection of answers.

## Skillsets

You will be exposed to the following skillsets;

1. Scripting user input
2. Saving data to csv file

## Expectations

I expect you to work in your teams to create a script that will take input from users and then store their responses to a CSV file.
It must aggregate the responses of multiple users and therefore needs to have some form of disambiguation involved in the data generation process. 

## Prerequisites

The only thing that you will need is Bash and text files, all of which are available in CodeAnywhere.

## Instructions

You will need to do the following for this assignment to be considered complete. 

1. Create a list of five questions.
2. Write a script that will do the following:
  - Ask each question of the user running the script.
  - Write a random string of characters to a variable as a unique identifier.
  - Write the datestamp to a variable.
  - Accept text input from the user and write each answer as a variable.
  - Save all answers and other data to a CSV file.
